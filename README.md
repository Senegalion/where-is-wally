# Where's Wally? Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can locate Wally in images from the classic childhood game "Where's Wally?". The goal is to identify whether Wally is present in a given image and to provide a simulated path for Wally to move once found.

## Objectives

- Process images to determine the presence of Wally.
- Train a classifier using deep learning techniques.
- Optionally implement a pathfinding algorithm for Wally's movement.

## Features

- Image preprocessing to standardize input data.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification.
- Visualization of results and Wally's path (if implemented).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - NumPy
  - OpenCV
  - TensorFlow
  - Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow matplotlib
```
